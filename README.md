project 1:
Simple Calculator
This simply works by taking three user inputs grouped into one scanf() function. These are seperated into valueOne, valueTwo and the operator (choice of *,/,+,-,^). A switch statement is then used in order to run the right calculation for the given operator. Mess around with the code and change bits here and there.



project 2:
TASK:
Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.
